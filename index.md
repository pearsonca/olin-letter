## Prompt: An Olin-specific cover letter

Tell us why youâ€™re excited to join us as we work with students to help them
grow, create new types of educational experiences, and change engineering
education. Show us how you like to be creative and collaborative. Discuss how
you might like to grow intellectually. Imagine what student-centered experiences
you might co-design with colleagues. Share your vision for what might be
possible at Olin and in the world.

## Response

 - excited about focus on getting "students" doing things
 - not sure how much Olin is doing this, but interested in getting away from
 one-set-of-ideas, one-class, one-semester mode.  Probably means developing more
 modular reference / training material, figuring out to evaluate full range of
 skills - measured by ability to complete a project that demands them? how to do
 team evaluation
