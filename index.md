## Prompt: An Olin-specific cover letter

Tell us why youâ€™re excited to join us as we work with students to help them
grow, create new types of educational experiences, and change engineering
education. Show us how you like to be creative and collaborative. Discuss how
you might like to grow intellectually. Imagine what student-centered experiences
you might co-design with colleagues. Share your vision for what might be
possible at Olin and in the world.

## Response

I am excited about Olin for the same reason people join start-ups
instead of established corporations: you all are doing something different and risky.
Olin's emphasis on *doing* as a means -- rather than ends -- to education, upends
the conventional approach.  I think it's prescient as well: when peak credentialism hits,
the vellum won't be what matters, it will be what people have actually done.

Unlike, say, Peter Thiel, however, I don't think dispensing with the university
environment is the answer.  I am sympathetic to problems with mainstream
approaches, but Olin's academic statement is, to me, about remembering what
established undergraduate programs seem to have lost: the university is about
creating -- not just transferring -- knowledge, via novices working with experts.
A traditional lecture-style class, no matter how effective, is only there to
send facts and evaluate their receipt.  That format will soon be mostly
displaced (and good riddance) by services like Coursera.

We can take as given that the facts and procedures typical to an undergraduate technical program are
floating around the www waiting to be absorbed, and that our role can be limited
to a little curation and actively encouraging them to share finds with each other.
However, that alone is hardly worth four years of someone's time, no matter
how much trivia was covered.

What I hope to do instead at Olin is leverage this trend to make time for
inciting healthy failures.  Science and technological development and learning
all advance via practiced trial and error, by fathoming the depths of a
particular idea as well as prospecting for new ones in unlikely places.  As
experts, we've survived that to arrive at comfortable local optima in how we
approach interesting problems.  Lecture-style classes live in this easy space:
focusing on those approaches, and the problems are incidental.

It's rut-inducing.

But the new normal of MOOCs, Wikipedia, StackExchange sites, streaming
Mythbusters, *etc.* is an opportunity for *us*: we can use our expertise to
*inquire* in the classroom, and shift focus to good problems.  The novices,
without being told what to do, will rehash and remix old solutions into new
places, and no doubt occasionally make *really* crazy connections.

This will let us all break out of those local optima.  What's also great about this approach
is that it unifies what it means to be a great teacher and to advance the
field: we don't have to choose or be superhuman to have both.

I hope Olin is already thinking this way, and I hope to help you push further in
this direction.  Particularly, I want to explore domains that are not traditionally
approached with the engineering mindset -- both to apply engineering skills to these
fertile grounds, but also to confront future engineers with enough mess to get them out of
their comfort zone.

My recent work has been transitioning from physical sciences and engineering to
natural and social sciences.  I've been particularly focusing on infectious
disease ecology, which roughly encompasses problems concerning how
environmental, human, and domestic and wild animal factors conspire to circulate
pathogens.  These systems have surprising interactions -- *e.g.* how
mosquitos detect and respond to smell can be modulated by infections! -- demanding
care in both modeling and experimental work.  But these are more than just fascinating
problems: the chance to improve the human condition is palpable.  Think
about the Ebola coverage, and how horrifying it is - yet that doesn't even begin
to scratch the surface of malaria, dengue, chikunyunga, and what those ignored
afflictions wreak upon already hard-pressed people.  These are terrific
opportunities to improve and enrich lives.

That's the kind of challenge that I hope to work with students to address, to show them
a very different sort of engineering problem, and to show the world what the kind
of thinking fostered at Olin can produce.

## END



My recent work has been transitioning from physical sciences and engineering to
ecological and social science work.  What I miss the most is the sort of tools
that enable converting tangible thinking into artifacts that are suitable for
further automated work.  There is no polished frontend for modeling disease
dynamics comparable to the toolkits available to people doing, say,
computational fluid dynamics, but as the ongoing Ebola outbreak highlights,
there is plenty of need for such a thing.

Making such products a reality is something I'd happily devote my time towards,
and there are a myriad of pieces to constructing a real solution to those kinds
of problem.  I invite you to imagine the complexity of calibrating various
approaches to capturing mosquitos to a useful end quantitatively modeling their
role in the spread of disease.
> missing word between end and quantitatively?

Now deploy it in rural Bangladesh.  When no one is offering more than a shoestring
to fund it.

> deploy what?

That very real measurement challenge is perfectly
suited to the engineering mindset, but I'm not familiar with many in our discipline
that work to those sort of ends.  That's what I'd bring to Olin students - the sort
of problems that aren't being typically presented as something that might want to
tackle.

But look at malaria mortality.  Dengue mortality.  West nile.  Chikunyunga.  These
are terrific opportunities to improve and enrich lives.

I look forward to the opportunity to align the enthusiasm of place like Olin to
solving such problems.

Juliet Notes:

 - first few paras, confusing grammatical structure, word choice.  order in 1st para
 too dense
 - try be positive about Olin without being down on traditional universities
 - pun confusing
 - classroom / class-like structure - don't say classes are the worst, posit not
 having classes, what would be gained from having no semester schedule / credits
 - maybe move some of those things to student development / impact statement

hold:

the environment you are trying to create
feels like the right antidote to credential-focus that is sneaking into
traditional settings.  If what I read about you is correct, Olin seems to understand
the point Peter Thiel has made with his eponymous fellowship and is trying to find a way that
to address that short-coming, but for all students.  The community at Olin recognizes that the university
setting is positively chemical, and you all appear to embrace that energy --
danger included.  That attitude acknowledges the need for risk, dispenses with routine, but retains
a place for mentorship and catalyzing peers.

I've been embedded in highly regimented, corporate institutions for awhile now (the military and traditional academia), and I'm convinced that while there are many valuable aspects of
those cultures, that they aren't really my place.  I need to be with people that are comfortable
with questioning (and discarding) the rules - the kind of thinking that pervades startup culture.

There is a lot of healthy and valuable innovation blowing up education in the
connected setting.  I think that's definitely the future of rote skills training,
at least when combined with the opportunity to practice said skills (easy for computer programming,
less so when you don't have a CNC machine at home), and Olin seems to be doing some
of that -- hard to judge if you're doing "plenty" or "enough" from the outside,
but I have high hopes.

Those practical skills and the intuition that only comes with brow-sweat and elbow
grease earning them are absolutely critical.  But, as mathy types like myself enjoy
quipping: "necessary but not sufficient."

What I think is happening at Olin, or that I help could catalyze happening, is leveraging those
incredible resources to let faculty focus on identifying the best possible projects
for novices, and guiding their effort on those real accomplishments, rather than directing
student effort on fact or procedure acquisition and recall.

I think the best possible learning experiences stem from engaging work with real results,
and real possibility of failure.  A class, even the best class, can only be
about learning something - a change in ourselves, not the world - and its easy
to fall to thinking "this is just a class".  The consequences of a class are
always limited to a grade, never a visceral failure.  But figuring out some
novel problem or building some new device or any of the myriad other ways of
"doing" -- these activities are real, and may have no pretty answers.

These kind of opportunities have the power to excite and engage in the way that
no directed classroom ever could.  The novices will be inspired to learn the necessary
skills to contribute, not to pass some test.  The experts can be equally excited
in a way that the task of rehashing material in some abstracted setting never can,
and that sort of enthusiasm is contagious.  The classroom is also a poor setting
for actually seeing a master *work*: to make mistakes and right them, to discard
false starts, to pick back up what was once discarded, to buckle down on boring details
and to play with ideas creatively.

One last point about going beyond the packaged classroom learning (no matter how well packaged it may be):
today's experts are at best familiar with today's solutions, and are mostly familiar
with yesterday's solutions.  Asked to produce classroom material, we are going to
provide problems and projects that mostly likely indicate solutions we can evaluate,
and thus are very unlikely to capitalize on all the novelty available in fresh students.  Instead,
if asked to identify challenges, we are likely to dig up things that at least have the possibility of inspiring
new approaches, though certainly we will see plenty of re-use of traditional solutions.

Traditional universities are plodding along safely churning out graduates who's
primary benefit is the imprimatur of a degree and the selectivity of the
institution they attended.  I think employers are increasingly cognizant of
this, as are students.  Services like Coursera are obviating introductory skills
and facts courses, and making that material available ala carte as required for
an individual or team to overcome emergent challenges.  People like Peter Thiel
(via his eponymous fellowship) are actively encouraging people to skip the
degree entirely.

The first trend means eliminating the first few years in most programs, the
second means skipping the last few.  Why would anyone choose to plunk down a
huge capital investment if that's the situation?  This indicates a pretty radical
reformation is coming for the academy.

I think Olin might be taking the right kinds of risks relative to this impending
transition.  Instead of doubling-down on the credentialing model (like many
  traditional universities are by focusing their hiring in adjuncts and expanding
  their online programs) or abandoning the university ideal, Olin is positioning itself to
  embrace a third way: treating students as participants and
  partners, rather than subjects, in genuine work, instead of cookie-cutter classes.

  I'm fairly eclectic when it comes to what sort of problem to work on -- relative
  to my skill-set, it's all equations and code, but I always like to learn about
  new domains and I like to see effective work pipelines for those domains.  I see
  myself working with those phenomenological experts
  > What is a phenomenological expert? Otherwise, i like this paragraph

  to craft challenges that result
  in both new insight as well as new, high quality tools with flexible
  applicability.  I'd also like to move into work where the modeling and analysis
  component is working directly with feedback with some surveillance system, like
  realtime disease modeling on an agricultural system working in tandem with
  drones taking temperature, humidity, etc data around the fields.
  > Might be useful to say a little more specific stuff about your background (eg, mention you're currently working on Ebola modeling) before you mention this - comes a bit out of the blue

  These are areas where the "right" answer isn't settled, making it ripe terrority
  for engaging students.  There are no fake problem sets, or "known"s.  More importantly,
  I think, students working with experts on these problems will see how experts
  handle setbacks and even failure.
  > Hugely important point; might also be something to emphasize earlier?

  It seems weird to end on that note, but one other key element missing from classrooms
  is real failure.  Sure, students might not get the grade they want.  They can
  blame not cramming enough, or the instructor being a poor communicator, or somesuch.
  But that's fake failure, just like good grades are fake success.  It's not same
  kind of failure as a multi-year project falling apart.
  > failing apart?

  They need to see people
  take defeats and keep going, and how they decide between redirecting and doubling
  down.
