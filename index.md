## Prompt: An Olin-specific cover letter

Tell us why youâ€™re excited to join us as we work with students to help them
grow, create new types of educational experiences, and change engineering
education. Show us how you like to be creative and collaborative. Discuss how
you might like to grow intellectually. Imagine what student-centered experiences
you might co-design with colleagues. Share your vision for what might be
possible at Olin and in the world.

## Summary Statement

When I first heard about Olin a little more than a decade ago, I
seriously considered leaving my prestigious, but very traditional undergraduate
institution for the opportunity to be involved with a program that from all
descriptions was tailored for me personally.  I am, on balance, glad I did not,
as I was nearly done at the time, and then proceeded directly to Navy service, which
proved to be an experience I cannot imagine trading.

But I still think it was a close thing, and I continued to follow Olin's
trajectory breaking from the certificate-assembly-line thinking that seems to
permeate even the most respected institutions.  I have always kept in the back
of my mind that I might still go to Olin, and I think now is the time to do so.

I suppose my role will be a bit different than I initially imagined, but I hope
not too much so.  As I elaborate on my statement about student development, I want
my engagement with the students to be one of mutual learning.

re student-centered experiences: I want to push back on this notion - what we want to be doing
is genuinely engaging work, and we want students to be pulled into that work in
a way that excites them to be involved, and inspires them to learn the necessary
skills to usefully contribute.  Yes, that means thinking very carefully about that
work and how novices participate - but I'm not sure starting from "think about the children" is compatible
with inspiring journeymen and masters to engage with the work in way that the novices
can witness, admire, and emulate.

expert produced problem sets is going to tend towards training existing-expert solutions,
not novel solutions.

Not suggesting abandoning all traditional teaching activities, but I think there's a lot
to be done breaking out one-set-of-ideas, one-class, one-semester mode.  Probably means developing more
 modular reference / training material, figuring out to evaluate full range of
 skills - measured by ability to complete a project that demands them? how to do
 team evaluation
