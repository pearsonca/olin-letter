prompt: "Tell us why youâ€™re excited to join us as we work with students to help them
grow, create new types of educational experiences, and change engineering
education. Show us how you like to be creative and collaborative. Discuss how
you might like to grow intellectually. Imagine what student-centered experiences
you might co-design with colleagues. Share your vision for what might be
possible at Olin and in the world."

I am excited about Olin for the same reason people join start-ups
instead of established corporations: you all are doing something different and risky.
Olin's emphasis on *doing* as a means -- rather than ends -- to education, upends
the conventional approach.  I think it's prescient as well: when peak credentialism hits,
the vellum won't be what matters, it will be what people have actually done.

Unlike, say, Peter Thiel, however, I don't think dispensing with the university
environment is the answer.  I am sympathetic to problems with mainstream
approaches, but Olin's academic statement is, to me, about remembering what
established undergraduate programs seem to have lost: the university is about
creating -- not just transferring -- knowledge, via novices working with experts.
A traditional lecture-style class, no matter how effective, is only there to
send facts and evaluate their receipt.  That format will soon be mostly
displaced (and good riddance) by services like Coursera.

We can take as given that the facts and procedures typical of an undergraduate technical program are
floating around the www waiting to be absorbed, and that our role can be limited
to a little curation and actively encouraging students to share finds with each other.
However, that alone is hardly worth four years of someone's time, no matter
how much material was covered.

What I hope to do instead at Olin is leverage this trend to make time for
inciting healthy failures.  Science and technological development and learning
all advance via practiced trial and error, by fathoming the depths of a
particular idea as well as prospecting for new ones in unlikely places.  As
experts, we've survived that to arrive at comfortable local optima in how we
approach interesting problems.  Lecture-style classes live in this easy space:
focusing on those approaches, and the problems are incidental.

It's rut-inducing.

But the new normal of MOOCs, Wikipedia, StackExchange sites, streaming
Mythbusters, *etc.* is an opportunity for *us*: we can use our expertise to
*inquire* in the classroom, and shift focus to good problems.  The novices,
without being told what to do, will rehash and remix old solutions into new
places, and no doubt occasionally make *really* crazy connections.

This will let us all break out of those local optima.  What's also great about this approach
is that it unifies what it means to be a great teacher and to advance the
field: we don't have to choose or be superhuman to have both.

I hope Olin is already thinking this way, and I hope to help you push further in
this direction.  Particularly, I want to explore domains that are not traditionally
approached with the engineering mindset -- both to apply engineering skills to these
fertile grounds, but also to confront future engineers with enough mess to get them out of
their comfort zone.

My recent work has been transitioning from physical sciences and engineering to
natural and social sciences.  I've been particularly focusing on infectious
disease ecology, which roughly encompasses problems concerning how
environmental, human, and domestic and wild animal factors conspire to circulate
pathogens.  These systems have surprising interactions -- *e.g.* how mosquitos
detect and respond to smell can be modulated by infections! -- demanding care in
both modeling and experimental work.  But these are more than just fascinating
problems: the chance to improve the human condition is palpable.  Think about
the Ebola coverage, and how horrifying it is - yet that doesn't even begin to
scratch the surface of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, and what they inflict on
already hard-pressed people.  Fighting any of these diseases would be a terrific opportunity
to improve and enrich lives.

That's the kind of challenge that I hope to work with students to address, to show them
a very different sort of engineering problem, and to show the world what the kind
of thinking fostered at Olin can produce.
