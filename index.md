## Prompt: An Olin-specific cover letter

Tell us why youâ€™re excited to join us as we work with students to help them
grow, create new types of educational experiences, and change engineering
education. Show us how you like to be creative and collaborative. Discuss how
you might like to grow intellectually. Imagine what student-centered experiences
you might co-design with colleagues. Share your vision for what might be
possible at Olin and in the world.

## Summary Statement

I am excited about working at Olin because the environment you are trying to create
there is precisely the antidote to the credential-obsessed populations (students,
faculty, administrators, the works) at traditional institutions.  The university
*setting* is positively chemical, and Olin appears to embrace that energy --
danger included -- while the incumbent players are content to keep turning the
status crank.

I guess I prefer to be on the team running into the explosions, rather than sitting in
what everyone else finds to be comfortable stability.  I feel like U235, looking
for friends -- though I'm hoping to exercise that restless energy via immersion,
rather than being squeezed too tight.

Fission puns aside: traditional universities, as much as good as they do, are
highly regimented, boring, corporate places, and I'm in the mood for a risky, startup culture.

And I think Olin might be doing something extremely risky: treating students as
participants and partners, rather than subjects, in genuine work, instead of classes.

There is a lot of healthy and valuable innovation blowing up education in the
connected setting.  I think that's definitely the future of rote skills training,
at least when combined with the opportunity to practice said skills (easy for computer programming,
less so when you don't have a CNC machine at home), and Olin seems to be doing some
of that -- hard to judge if you're doing "plenty" or "enough" from the outside,
but I have high hopes.

Those practical skills and the intuition that only comes with brow-sweat and elbow
grease earning them are absolutely critical.  But, as mathy types like myself enjoy
quipping: "necessary but not sufficient."

What I think is happening at Olin, or that I help could catalyze happening, is leveraging those
incredible resources to let faculty focus on identifying the best possible projects
for novices, and guiding their effort on those real accomplishments, rather than directing
student effort on fact or procedure acquisition and recall.

I think the best possible experiences stem from engaging work with real results,
and real possibility of failure.  A class, even the best class, can only be
about learning something - a change in ourselves, not the world - and its easy
to fall to thinking "this is just a class".  The consequences of a class are
always limited to a grade, never a visceral failure.  But figuring out some
novel problem or building some new device or any of the myriad other ways of
"doing" -- these activities are real, and may have no pretty answers.

These kind of opportunities have the power to excite and engage in the way that
no directed classroom ever could.  The novices will be inspired to learn the necessary
skills to contribute, not to pass some test.  The experts can be equally excited
in a way that the task of rehashing material in some abstracted setting never can,
and that sort of enthusiasm is contagious.  The classroom is also a poor setting
for actually seeing a master *work*: to make mistakes and right them, to discard
false starts, to pick back up what was once discarded, to buckle down on boring details
and to play with ideas creatively.

One last point about going beyond the packaged classroom learning (no matter how well packaged it may be):
today's experts are at best familiar with today's solutions, and are mostly familiar
with yesterday's solutions.  Asked to produce classroom material, we are going to
provide problems and projects that mostly likely indicate solutions we can evaluate,
and thus are very unlikely to capitalize on all the novelty available in fresh students.  Instead,
if asked to identify challenges, we are likely to dig up things that at least have the possibility of inspiring
new approaches, though certainly we will see plenty of re-use of traditional solutions.

So what kind of challenges might I want to partner with other experts to solve with the help of students?

I'm in the middle of discipline transition from physical sciences and engineering to
ecological work.  What I miss the most is the sort of tools that enable converting
tangible thinking into artifacts that are suitable for further automated work.  There
is no CFD frontend for modeling disease dynamics, but as the ongoing Ebola outbreak
highlights, there is plenty of need for such a thing.

Making such products a reality is something I'd happily devote my time towards,
and there are a myriad of pieces to constructing a real solution to those kinds
of problem.  I invite you to imagine the complexity of calibrating various
approaches to capturing mosquitos to a useful end quantitatively modeling their
role in the spread of disease.

Now deploy it in rural Bangladesh.  When no one is offering more than a shoestring
to fund it.

That very real measurement challenge is perfectly
suited to the engineering mindset, but I'm not familiar with many in our discipline
that work to those sort of ends.  That's what I'd bring to Olin students - the sort
of problems that aren't being typically presented as something that might want to
tackle.

But look at malaria mortality.  Dengue mortality.  West nile.  Chikunyunga.  These
are terrific opportunities to improve and enrich lives.

I hope I get the chance to bring the enthusiasm of place like Olin to bear on such
problems.


Juliet Notes:

 - first few paras, confusing grammatical structure, word choice.  order in 1st para
 too dense
 - try be positive about Olin without being down on traditional universities
 - pun confusing
 - classroom / class-like structure - don't say classes are the worst, posit not
 having classes, what would be gained from having no semester schedule / credits
 - maybe move some of those things to student development / impact statement
