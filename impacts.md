## Prompt

We also expect faculty to be engaged in making a purposeful difference outside
of Olin â€“ through helping to change engineering education, through practice and
consulting, or through collaborative disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research. How might we change the world?

> If possible, talk about your Ghana courses as a concrete example of how you've taught courses guided - at least to some extent - by the principles you're espousing and how those courses could help make a difference (ie, why do technical training in Africa). In my view, this is the biggest thing currently missing from your application (discussion of the teaching you have done and how it's shaped your current thoughts/goals), and this seems like a reasonable place to put it

## Response

I concluded my response to the prompt concerning student development proposing
work in the developing world on controlling infectious disease.  This is a problem
that deserves a carefully applied engineering mindset, but *not* the traditional
beat-it-with-fancy-gadgets and we-know-best perspective.

That treats the people there as incompetent and disrespects them as subjects in a
way that is, frankly, colonial.  They have talent and drive to offer aplenty, and
what they need is trade partners, not people collecting gift receipts to make
themselves feel better.

They want to do business with some engineers who will get dirty with the data,
repurpose inventively, and liberally apply the elbow grease.  That means a lot
of going there and *feeling* it, and a lot of partnerships with people at the
front, not hanging out without pampered, right-thinking NGO types.

Students accustomed to doing and faculty accustomed to treating those students
as partners are strong candidates for that job.  This is the direction I've been
following with the software workshops in Ghana, and I think that US students
participating in an expanded version of that would be fruitful for all parties.  My focus has been on the
analytical and computational end, but I think the opportunities for fielding
solutions beyond the classroom abound.

Pursuing this lead would be a little of all the veins you mention in the prompt.

First, study abroad programs for engineering, especially for US students into developing regions,
are few and far between.  This would be a unique experience for the students on
both ends, not to mention that Olin's style of DIY-the-instructor-*doesn't*-know-best
courses is almost non-existent in Africa.

Second, we'd be over there because everyone involved wanted to contribute to
getting a mutually interesting obstacle demolished.  I suspect there would be
mix of work along the spectrum of speculative investigation to
practically-driven consultation to actual manufacture and assembly.

Which touches on the final point: the challenges in the developing world, like
most everywhere but amplified by a lack of a history of accumulated conveniences,
do not have simple, single discipline solutions.  Any work there, especially the
public health work that interests me, is going to need a union of many skillsets.

This would constitute changing the world: actually acheiving development
by embracing commerce and mutual respect over guilty handouts.

## END

I hope I've communicated that I think the most effective approach to student
development is to have them *do*.  If we're successful on our end, that *doing*
will change the world in two important ways:

 - Their accomplishment of something worthy.  We will have honed their sense of what
 is meaningful, and their skills to achieve it in a way that is incontrovertible.
 Even when they fail in something ambitious, they will leave behind new insight and
 tools for the next team.

 - Everyone will see the power of this approach.  Perhaps not everyone will be
 able to replicate it, but we can change the way people at large think about what
 "kids" can, and should, accomplish.

That's pretty talk, I agree, so I'd like to propose some concrete examples.  I think
that in general, engineering thinking isn't brought to bear on lots of problems, or
when it is, that thinking is about "what's the technological solution?" rather
than thinking about how these dirty, real world pieces fit together.

Preparing coursework

Education products:

 - putting together short, interactive tutorials for programming, modeling

Project ideas:

 - disease modeling tools
 - enhancing open source tools (pomp, plom)
 - partnerships in Africa, SE Asia for data gathering

I explained that my ideal version of a class produces actual product.  The work would have to be carefully
curated for its potential training value, and it is probably more slowly completed than it would
be by experts, but that work would create actual, (potentially) useful results nonetheless.

I think the bringing largely unsupervised, bright novices to bear on old problems
is itself guaranteed to create revolutionary results.  Lots of garbage as well,
but seeing as the point is more to shape them from novices into more experienced
individuals, even mostly garbage is fine.


 - collection of ecological / health / social data, modeling human interaction with the
 environment, using that understanding to identify novel intervention points
 - key skill set of replicable process / results, confidence in results
