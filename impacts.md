## Prompt

We also expect faculty to be engaged in making a purposeful difference outside
of Olin â€“ through helping to change engineering education, through practice and
consulting, or through collaborative disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research. How might we change the world?

## Response

Education products:

 - putting together short, interactive tutorials for programming, modeling

Project ideas:

 - disease modeling tools
 - enhancing open source tools (pomp, plom)
 - partnerships in Africa, SE Asia for data gathering

I explained that my ideal version of a class produces actual product.  The work would have to be carefully
curated for its potential training value, and it is probably more slowly completed than it would
be by experts, but that work would create actual, (potentially) useful results nonetheless.

I think the bringing largely unsupervised, bright novices to bear on old problems
is itself guaranteed to create revolutionary results.  Lots of garbage as well,
but seeing as the point is more to shape them from novices into more experienced
individuals, even mostly garbage is fine.


 - collection of ecological / health / social data, modeling human interaction with the
 environment, using that understanding to identify novel intervention points
 - key skill set of replicable process / results, confidence in results
