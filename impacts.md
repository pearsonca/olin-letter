layout: page
prompt: "We also expect faculty to be engaged in making a purposeful difference outside
of Olin â€“ through helping to change engineering education, through practice and
consulting, or through collaborative disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research. How might we change the world?"

I concluded my response to the prompt concerning student development proposing
work in the developing world on controlling infectious disease.  This is a
problem that deserves a carefully applied engineering mindset, which is
distinctly *not* the stereotypical beat-it-with-fancy-gadgets and we-know-best
perspective.  Africans have talent and drive to offer aplenty, and
what they want is partners -- people willing to engage in intellectual, economic, and social
exchange.  There are too many well-intentioned programs hamstrung by the notion
that Africans need "saving", when in many cases they prefer honest exchange for
the real value they have to offer.

In the case of technical experts, they want to do business with engineers who will
actually consider the situation before declaring the solution and will apply the
elbow grease alongside Africans to make the right approach succeed.

Students accustomed to making things - and faculty accustomed to treating those students
as equal contributors - are strong candidates for that kind of partnership.  This is the
direction I've been following with the software workshops in Ghana, and I think
that US students participating in an expanded version of that would be fruitful
for all parties.  My focus has been on the analytical and computational end, but
I think that opportunities for fielding solutions beyond the classroom abound.

I am suggesting, in short, that Olin could pursue something like study abroad /
exchange program in developing countries that maintains the institutional
emphasis on practical applications and entrepreneurship.  Pursuing this kind of
program could enrich all the veins mentioned in the prompt.

First, study abroad programs for engineering, especially for US students into
developing regions, are few and far between.  This would be a unique educational experience
for the students on both ends.  Post-colonial Africa remains stiflingly
hierarchical, and sadly this persists even into university education.  Olin's
style of DIY+the-instructor-*doesn't*-know-best is perhaps unheard of in the US,
but it's basically unimaginable for typical African students.  They adjust to
it, but I think they would do even better with peers as well as instructors
showing them the way.  Western students, on the other hand, are pampered in a
way that can stifle their imaginations.  Experiencing the absence of things they
take for granted can stimulate them to think about problems from new
perspectives, to question what parts are really necessary, and to have more
flexible, general answers.  Forging these relationships now will also, I
hope, become beneficial in a future where African countries and the US expand their
economic and intellectual cooperation.

Second, we'd be over there because everyone involved wanted to contribute to
getting a mutually interesting obstacle demolished.  I suspect there could be a
mix of work along the spectrum from speculative investigation to
practically-driven consultation to actual manufacture and assembly.  My goal
with the software workshops has always been to move in the direction of
addressing actual programming problems that locals wanted solved.  The first
year, we had the students incubate ideas.  This past year, we worked with a
hospital to understand their logistics (patient intake, scheduling, dispensary,
*etc.*) and used that to inspire student projects.  Unfortunately, we could not
close the loop with hospital representatives given the workshop timeline.
However, this coming year, our partnering with [AIMS Ghana](http://www.aims.edu.gh/) will identify projects
far in advance of the workshop and involve the researchers in both setting goals
for the workshop process as well as evaluating its results.  While I think
there's still room to more closely integrate research with practical outcomes,
we've made pretty good progress in three years time for a two-week program.

Finally, partnering with an organization like AIMS will intrinsically drive
multi-disciplinary approaches. They are, at heart, an applied mathematics
program, and they actively seek out real challenges in Africa for those
applications.  Those problems rarely live in a single traditional discipline,
even if they might seem to be through the lens of Western infrastructure.  In
many cases, the outputs of other disciplines that we could have "off-the-shelf"
are not available in developing contexts, so we have to work with experts in
those domains to figure out the alternatives.  Something as simple as assuming
that "if a particular commodity bolt wears out, a replacement can be obtained"
doesn't work when getting to the [nearest Home Depot involves airplanes](https://goo.gl/maps/TKbQV).  Any work there,
especially the public health work that interests me, is going to need a union of
many skillsets.

I think that connecting my current work with AIMS and other African partners with
the faculty and students at Olin is an immense opportunity for everyone.  The
experts at Olin would find new challenges and capable students, and the students on
both ends would gain perhaps the most influential peers in their lifetimes.  More
importantly, if successful, we would be showing the world a way to achieve development
by embracing exchange based on mutual respect.
