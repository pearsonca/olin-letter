## Prompt

We also expect faculty to be engaged in making a purposeful difference outside

consulting, or through collaborative disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research. How might we change the world?

 - collection of ecological / health / social data, modeling human interaction with the
 environment, using that understanding to identify novel intervention points
