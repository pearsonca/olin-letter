##Re Me

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher, dabbling in several fields (social science modeling, infectious disease ecology, software engineering) that have nothing to do with my doctoral work (physics, specifically theoretical statistical mechanics).  I've churned out several talks and posters, and am now settling into turning those in publications, most of which also include a software component for other researchers to use.

I am also a Navy Reservist working for the Office of Naval Research, with a mixed tasking as the software architect (and developer, and tester, etc) for our [program management software](https://edison.nrl.navy.mil), a software engineering course [coordinator and lead instructor](pearsonca.github.io/stdio-ghana), and the Executive Officer for the crew that supports a [fire-fighting test platform](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/field-sites/ex-uss-shadwell/).

Prior to getting my doctorate, I worked at [Naval Reactors Headquarters](http://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/powernavy2/aboutnr), mostly in the Reactor Components Division, New Reactor Design Group.  That job involved all aspects of engineering process (design, development, manufacturing, operation, and retirement), and many peer-reviewed technical publications.  However, because of the nature of the work, that's about the level detail that I can discuss, and of course none of those publications are publically available.

I also had a very formative practical engineering experience as the technical supervisor for a [student-run theater company](http://www.hoofnhorn.org/index.html) and the technical director for several shows.

##Olin + Me = ?

When I first read about Olin (my senior year in undergraduate), I distinctly remember thinking "well, I just wasted the past three years at the wrong school."  Each subsequent time I've seen Olin in the news, it just reinforces my wish that I had that kind of experience.  I did manage to get plenty of expertly coached, applied practice during undergraduate, but that almost entirely outside the planned and expected classroom experience.  I read about Olin's emphasis on doing -- with the theory of doing to support practice, not as an ends in itself -- and I just breathe a sigh of relief that at least *someone* gets it.

I'd love to come to Olin as a student *still*, but I do feel prepared to work there as faculty (of course, I hope that there's as much opportunity to learn in a faculty position).  My traditional engineering technical skills (e.g., what's the necessary thread spacing for this fastener? what are the flow characteristics coming off this nozzle?) are probably a bit rusty to be leading students on those topics any time soon.  However, I have been working pretty much continuously on integrating engineering and scientific concerns across disciplines for the past decade, and I am becoming quite sharp on the question of how to make a detailed, applied ecological model.

I think there's a real role for people with the engineering knack to direct their talents at understanding and modeling a complex system with many interdependent pieces, even if it's one they don't get to build.  The problems at hand are increasingly ones of how to use Nature's machinery, and they demand a remarkably delicate touch.  How can people produce food without destroying other environmental services (or introducing conditions that create, e.g., mosquito breeding paradises), in a way that is robust to new agricultural diseases, that provides ideal nutriution content, that people will actually want to *buy*, and that cannot be subverted by entrenched interests?  How can people eliminate disease in way that uses local, self-organization to combine prophalaxsis, treatment, environment and industrial changes, without bankrupting themselves?

So, I see myself at Olin as working with students to invent new ways to live in the *very* complicated ecological machinery.  Not quite the same as designing new machines, but certainly complementary and as valuable.

##Education, Training, and Building a Team with Both

I think the current university paradigm misses out (generally, not just in engineering and science education) on getting work done.  Certainly, there are problem sets aplenty, and the theory of how to get work done or what work is are covered just fine.  But getting something done means, among many other details, just how many threads that fastener does need.  And what material to make it from, and how to install it, and who is going to be installing it, and actually turning the wrench.  That's too much for any individual to adequately master, so getting real work done and making real advances means effective teams.

To be an effective team member, you have to know enough about what other people are doing to genuinely appreciate their work, and to be able to be heathily skeptical, to demand better.   I'd call that quality Education -- it's not being the best candidate to do something, but it's knowing enough to be able to work with someone that is.  I do think people have to get their hands dirty to get actual insight, however, and it's not my experience that traditional universities do very well on that count -- too much focus on something that's easy to grade, not enough on a product worth grading.

Of course, effective team members are also *really* good at their part of the solution.  That's Training -- really digging into the details and surviving the mess that inevitably results.  Certainly, the big picture is important to frame that work, but often times getting results is about throwing out the general rules that aren't good enough for this particular context.  I personally had maybe handful of classes with that kind of focus.  There are places that do training well enough, but they often completely divorce it from education on same topic.

Even if the traditional paths were good for education or training, what I think people really need is both, at the same time, and as a part of a team.  The team perspective is just as critical as the other pieces, but I didn't hear a whisper of that in an undergraduate classroom.

That's what I'm passionate about in education: getting students that accomplish something together, by having different pieces of a shared puzzle, and by being able to work together to make that happen without needing some "boss" steer.  I'm not sure how that happens from day zero, but I have some ideas about team-taught, project-oriented courses where students learn about the big picture challenge, and work as teams to address it, but different team members actually get different focused training on their piece.

##Questions

My main questions are
 - I know my cv looks light from a traditional university perspective; I'm hoping that Olin is looking for something else, however, and that I what I do have to offer matches that other thing.  So, are you? Does it?
 - is the kind of work I'd engage in -- systems modeling towards addressing something like the [OneHealth](http://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/) buzz challenges, but with a lens that also tends to encompass agricultural issues and deal with operational concerns -- the right match for Olin?  It's not work I ever heard advertised in an engineering context, and briefly bouncing around your public materials I don't see much that looks like it, but the problems do seem to need every skillset I've seen working as an engineer.
