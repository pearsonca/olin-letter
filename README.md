##Re Me

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher, dabbling in several fields (social science modeling, infectious disease ecology, software engineering) that have nothing to do with my doctoral work (physics, specifically theoretical statistical mechanics).  I have not made much progress in getting that work ``out the door'', but do have about a half dozen papers half finished.

I am also a Navy Reservist working for the Office of Naval Research, with a mixed tasking as a [software developer](https://edison.nrl.navy.mil) / [instructor](https://github.com/pearsonca/stdio-ghana) and the Executive Officer for the crew that supports a [fire-fighting test platform](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/field-sites/ex-uss-shadwell/).

Prior to getting my doctorate, I worked at [Naval Reactors Headquarters](http://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/powernavy2/aboutnr), mostly in the Reactor Components Division, New Reactor Design Group.  There's no way to confirm it, but I authored about 50 technical letters during my five years there.  That's about what I am allowed say about that.

I also had a very formative practical engineering experience as the technical supervisor for a [student-run theater company](http://www.hoofnhorn.org/index.html) and the technical director for several shows.

##Olin + Me = ?

Each time I've read about Olin in the newsmedia, I had a very clear thought: I wish I had that when I was an undergraduate.  What I enjoyed most about undergraduate was all of the coached practice I enjoyed, though that had nothing to do with the planned / expected classroom experience.  I read about Olin's emphasis on doing -- with the theory of doing to support practice, not as an ends in itself -- and I just breathe a sigh of relief that at least *someone* gets it.

I'd love to come to Olin as a student *still*, but I do feel prepared to work there as faculty (of course, I hope that there's as much opportunity to learn in a faculty position).  My traditional engineering technical skills (e.g., what's the necessary thread spacing for this fastener? what are the flow characteristics coming off this nozzle?) are probably a bit rusty to be leading students on those topics any time soon.  However, I have been working pretty much continuously on integrating engineering and scientific concerns across disciplines for the past decade, and I am becoming quite sharp on the question of how to make a detailed, applied ecological model.

I think there's a real role for people with the engineering knack to direct their talents at understanding and modeling a complex system with many interdependent pieces, even if it's one they don't get to build.  The problems at hand are increasingly ones of how to use Nature's machinery, and they demand a remarkably delicate touch.  How do can people produce food without destroying other environmental services (or introducing conditions that create, e.g., mosquito breeding paradises), in a way that is robust to new agricultural diseases, that provides ideal nutriution content, that people will actually want to *buy*, and that cannot be subverted by entrenched interests?  How can people eliminate disease in way that use local, self-organization to combine prophalaxsis, treatment, environment and industrial changes, without bankrupting themselves?

So, I see myself at Olin as working with students to invent new ways to live in the *very* complicated ecological machinery.  Not quite the same as designing new machines, but certainly complementary and as valuable.

##Training versus Education versus ...?

I think the current university paradigm misses out (generally, not just in engineering and science education) on getting work done.  Certainly, there are problem sets aplenty, and the theory of how to get work done or what work is are covered just fine.  But getting something done means, among many other details, just how many threads that fastener does need.  And what material to make it from, and how to install it, and who is going to be installing it, and actually turning the wrench.  That's too much for any individual to adequately master.

To be an effective team member, you have to know enough about what other people are doing to both genuinely appreciate it and to also be able to suitably skeptical.  Of course, you also have to be *really* good at your part of the solution.
