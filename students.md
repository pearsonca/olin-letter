## Prompt

One way we measure faculty success is by how our activities and accomplishments
contribute to student development. This doesn’t just happen in the classroom,
and it’s often not a one-person show. How might we approach designing
experiences to help students grow?

## Response

 - worry less about designing experiences, and more about providing stimulating
 challenges, opportunities to use tools, etc.
 - yes, always some design element: making sure to have good pacing, relevant
 challenge, opportunities to learn new things not just apply old tricks, etc.
 however, we should want the sort of students that are break any plan that is to
 specific.  that means instructors that themselves are ready to adjust course on
 the fly
