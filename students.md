## Prompt: A description of your philosophy of student learning and development

One way we measure faculty success is by how our activities and accomplishments
contribute to student development. This doesn’t just happen in the classroom,
and it’s often not a one-person show. How might we approach designing
experiences to help students grow?

## Response

In the cover letter, I explained that the undergraduate setting
needs to focus on creating rather than transmitting of knowledge.  This my position
for several reasons:

 - someone else will almost surely do pure transmission better, and that entity
 will be accessible almost everywhere with internet.
 - classes that are only about "the material" or "learning objectives", rather
 than addressing some tangible result, are less engaging
 - "imperfect" communication of past knowledge takes advantage
 of novices ability to explore alternatives, while "perfect" rote lectures would
 preclude it

We are never going to be all things to all students like the internet can be
when it comes to shining a light on particular facts or procedure.  Yes, when we
have some insight on some problem, we should share it into that Leviathan, but
we shouldn't be trying to compete with the Khan on that front.  Instead, our
focus there should be on advising novices on how to make those resources work for
them: common places to get started, the need to verify information,
why we provide attribution, and so on.

On the next point, when it comes to detailed "learning objectives", no one is
better (worse) than the military.  Too often, these objectives are bandied about
without ever attempting to convince people why the material matters - which is
also basically what happens in many undergraduate degrees with highly structured
requirements.  It's a game masquerading a recipe of the things one needs to
know, and too often provide a false sense of accomplishment as students tick
them off the list.  Walking through the checklist also wears down the experts;
we're frequently the sort of people that are looking for the next new thing, and
asking those people to rehash material over and over isn't going to excite
*them*.  Effectively guiding students has a strong performance art component, and
they can tell when we're phoning it in.

To me, the solution is to put creating knowledge in focus, and attend to
grokking past understanding in service of that goal.  We can do both by posing
good challenges, keeping positive pressure on students as they engage with those
challenges, and offering a helping hand when they fall (but not before, and not
until they can say that they have tripped). As they engage with real problems,
we can prod them to reflect on what exactly they're doing, why one approach
worked when another didn't, and what might apply to other situations.  The
Socratic method applied to practical concerns.

I've been using this approach for a few years, both informally (and infuriatingly,
they happily tell me) working with people at University of Florida and
as organizer and lead instructor at software engineering workshops in Ghana.
At Olin, I anticipate working in a similar capacity: my personal passion is scientific story-telling with   mathematical models, particularly programmatic models.  I think that's probably
a good direct fit into your current offering *SCI 1111: MODELING AND SIMULATION OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD*,
though I'd be enthusiastic about creating an *...OF THE NATURAL WORLD* option,
and critically, linking it to some field work.

What I would most like to contribute to student development is convincing them that the engineering
mindset isn't just about finding the "right" gadget: it's about understanding
how many moving parts conspire to create results, and how we approach can balancing
those parts (be they cogs or hogs) in way that improves our lot.  I'm also quite
keen on engineering problems far-away from the simplifications of Western infrastructure.

I have in mind a variety of projects that would taking a modeling approach to
ecological systems, combined with clever laboratory and field surveillance (autonomously deploying mosquito
traps!), to achieve useful forecasting for public health challenges and eventually identify
interventions.  I know the modeling part, but only a vague outline of the other parts,
so I'm really looking forward to working with other faculty and students crazy enough to try making
this approach viable in places like rural Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

## END

I am always emphasizing the *story*
part, which was certainly rare in my own development.   To make that really
work, there are several other key ingredients: a story to   tell - a particular
phenomenological system, the detailed realization of the   story - choices in
how software is engineered, and of course a reason to tell   the story -
predictions, experiments, studies.  I've bounced around those   roles, and am
always looking for partners to take up any of them.  Each aspect   is also rich
with opportunities for novices to become engaged.

This coming summer, I will be applying
it again at the African Institute for Mathematic Sciences Ghana site (AIMS
  Ghana) as we discuss software engineering while applying those ideas to
  polishing dissertation code into software for general use.

I try to gauge my interactions with a student by the amount I'm in pure send mode versus receive
or respond.  If I'm the only one blabbing (or drawing or coding or whatever) all the time,
then it's garbage.  I believe the only way people advance is by the work they own, and hence students
need to be in the driver's seat if they (or we) want to get anywhere.

That perspective has a variety of implications for traditional classroom oriented courses,
but mostly it leads me to think that setting -- having a syllabus, textbook, exams
on pre-set requirements, wizened fellow at a blackboard -- is not very useful for actual learning.  Some people
can squeeze a little experience from that stone, and perhaps the tech'd up version
of it is superior, but the fundamental problems remain.

Students know the challenges aren't real, and we are only teaching what we already know.

I think there is plenty of real work out there could provide the basis for a course
of study.  The amateurs could tackle that work, with feedback and supervision by
relative experts.  Mostly, this would result in not-so-great work product, but
that's fine - the students would be learning.  Occasionally, the product would
be fine, and we can ship it.  Rarely, some students will avoid the trap we suffer
from (our past assumptions) and discover something new.

This is way almost everything is learned in the real world, so why take away that process just
because an expert is in the room?
> awk - add 'the'?

Now to the prompt: what do our activities and accomplishments have to do with
that perspective?

This approach requires a constant churn of new problems, and careful curation
of those to match the best challenges to students (right level, right flavor to entice, etc).
That's mediated by the faculty, how catholic they are in their own interests,
and how often their connections and past successes bring new opportunities.

Imagine it in terms of a medieval crafthall.  The work that the apprentices have to
grow on is determined by the past successes of the masters, who else they work with,
and what work they are seeking out.

Extending that analogy in a way that's increasing relevant to the contemporary era,
an apprentice making horseshoes for blacksmith versus one applying them for a farrier
versus a third learning horses from a veterinarian.  All learn different things about a
shared problem, and learn different things about their trades from the problem.
> increasingly ? learning about?

I don't think I'm going out on a limb to say that the scientists and engineers
being trained today will increasingly face challenges with deeper specialization requirements
at the same time as broader integration demands.  As such, it is our responsibility
to find opportunities *now* that will confront them with this reality, so that
they can see how we respond to them (accepting that we can't do everything, having
the healthy skepticism for our collaborates
> collabortors?

that induces their best, e.g.) and
so that we help them build up endurance for the aspects that are inevitably hard
and praise creativity that allows them to sidestep the things we *thought* were
unavoidable.

I'm going to conclude with an outline of what I think would make a good course
(that I could teach) that highlights this perspective.  After years of training
as a physicist and engineer, I'm currently working almost exclusively on problems
in the social and natural sciences.  To me, the actual point of that training was learning
what made a good mathematical model, the right mix of: emphasizing the relevant
relationships and measurements, feasibility for analysis, computational representability,
connection to experiment, and so on.

The course would be titled something like *Modeling-based Infectious Disease Ecology*.  Obviously,
plenty of other subjects content would be amenable to this approach, but I'd like
to show prospective engineers that their skill sets can be useful in non-traditional fields.
> draw back to disease examples in the cover letter ('summary') to help explain why you've chosen this - just a brief introductory phrase or clause should do it; also, I think you're missing an apostrophe at the end of subjects

We would then proceed through some classic papers, discussing principles highlighted
in them, and replicating (or not!) those model and results using modern computational
approaches.  I'd particularly want to focus on papers that included large scale
interventions that involved serious engineering considerations (e.g., logistics of
vaccine distribution, industrial agriculture), that were *not* modeled and induce
the students to attack that part of the problem.

About mid-way through the course, students would select some under appreciated datasets (e.g., Garki malaria study), and work towards integrating those with models that produced results
highlighting what experiments need to be done to understand some important input.
They will of course also need to work out the rough outlines of that experiment
to ensure feasibility.

# OLD DRAFT

## Response

Any culture -- including Science and Engineering as broad disciplines -- grows
or dies according to how it recruits new adherents.

This is what fundamentally drives how I think about "student development", and
thus how I try to work with novices.

Certainly, there are the facts and routines that represent the everyday core of
our activity, and these are critical to communicate.  However, these have
changed substantially in our lifetimes, and hopefully will continue to do so
over the lives of those that come after us.  As such, I think these particulars should be
incidental rather than focal.

Instead, we should simply focus on available work.

If I were leading a mathematical modeling course, rather than worry about a syllabus
first, I'd go look for some modeling problems I'd like to tackled, which would
be appropriate for novices (possibly after dividing into smaller pieces).  I'd draft a plan of attack for how I
would tackle those challenges, and then I'd make sure I was ready to talk about
the critical points in those plans, including what domain experts I'd want to engage.
My own mercurial, type-A preferences would probably result in problems which are diverse
and which touch all the aspects I think make for good modeling work (connection to
data and new experiments, requiring a good mix of traditional pen-and-paper analytics
and computation, all the while telling a good story), but I'd want to double-check
that I'd gotten a suitably good scope.

Then I would let the students loose on these problems, with little other than
the problem description to begin on.

After that, I view my role as a mix of demanding customer and expert consultant.
I'll want to see regular progress towards some outcome, and I'll be quite vocal
about what I do and don't like about the work so far.  When they get stuck,
I'll try to provide the slightest re-direction in order to get them underway
again.  Bit by bit, these ne

I expect the results of such an approach to be quite a bit of blood, sweat, and
tears for some not very pretty results.

Critically, however: they will own

One, student development does not occur in traditional classrooms.

Two, student development is never a one-person show.

Three, I think we should stop calling them students.

I object to two premises in the prompt: the idea of a distinct class
"students" and the notion of designing experiences.  Bear with me, because I hope
you agree those objections to the framing are actually consistent with how you
see Olin enriching the discipline of engineering and lives of engineers.

Any organization -- business, charity, academy, *etc.* -- lives or dies by
how it brings in new people and new ideas.  Does it carefully balance passing on
what has worked in the past?  Or does it fall to extremes, forgetting past lessons
or stifling new innovations (or worse, both)?

Honestly, I'm not sure I like the idea of "students".  There are always new members
of the on-going adventure in science and engineering, and sure, more seasoned
participants are around to help the novices become effective as soon as possible.
Yet, those "teachers" should still be studying the craft themselves, and expect
to gain novel insight from these initiates (and of course those more experienced than
themselves).

**TODO, like the idea of:**
> Yes, there are many practices that have survived the arc of history, but remarkably few specific ideas that continue unblemished.
**not sure how to integrate?**

Perhaps my objection seems semantic rather than practical, but I think it presents
two important insights:

 - we should be engaging the group we currently call "students" more like apprentices:
 get them involved in the doing, and pass on insight as part of that doing
 - this is not a special time for learning in their lives, and treating it as
 such may deny them the opportunity to acquire the perspective or skills they will
 need to ensure the future of the discipline

Does such a perspective permit *designing* how we best enable people to become
the best possible participants in our discipline?  Generally, I think no: we do
not generally get to design the challenges we face.  Rather, the task is more akin
to improvisation.  There is a great deal of preparation: of material, for facing
uncertainty, etc.  And that improv is put on by troupe, so we need to know the talents
of our fellows, so we can hand off where appropriate, trust their response,
be comfortable not hogging the spotlight, *etc*.

But that is rehearsal, not design.  Design just seems too inflexible a connotation.
The design part is selling tickets, getting the audience in the door - not what
happens during the show.

Perhaps I'm saying I think the design part is quite simple: get these new engineering
recruits working on interesting problems, starting with parts that they can
engage with, and have a plan for providing them feedback on their work and
access to resources that they will need to solve those problems.

But rehearsal to make that design successful is going to be rough, because I think
that looks almost nothing like the traditional education most of us received:
lectures, homework, and exams.

Julie notes:

 - disagreeing with design seems confrontational - don't really seem to disagree
 with design, so much as what other people are calling design: creating static
 artifact
 - add concrete practical experience: probably from structure of STDIO course,
 with course emphasis on having project, then sessions on how to attack the problem

pulled from cover:

Not suggesting abandoning all traditional teaching activities, but I think there's a lot
to be done breaking out one-set-of-ideas, one-class, one-semester mode.  Probably means developing more
 modular reference / training material, figuring out to evaluate full range of
 skills - measured by ability to complete a project that demands them? how to do
 team evaluation
