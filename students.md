## Prompt

One way we measure faculty success is by how our activities and accomplishments
contribute to student development. This doesn’t just happen in the classroom,
and it’s often not a one-person show. How might we approach designing
experiences to help students grow?

## Response

I object to two premises in the prompt: the idea of a distinct class
"students" and the notion of designing experiences.  Bear with me, because I hope
you agree those objections to the framing are actually consistent with how you
see Olin enriching the discipline of engineering and lives of engineers.

Any organization -- business, charity, academy, *etc.* -- lives or dies by
how it brings in new people and new ideas.  Does it carefully balance passing on
what has worked in the past?  Or does it fall to extremes, forgetting past lessons
or stifling new innovations (or worse, both)?

Honestly, I'm not sure I like the idea of "students".  There are always new members
of the on-going adventure in science and engineering, and sure, more seasoned
participants are around to help the novices become effective as soon as possible.
Yet, those "teachers" should still be studying the craft themselves, and expect
to gain novel insight from these initiates (and of course those more experienced than
themselves).

**TODO, like the idea of:**
> Yes, there are many practices that have survived the arc of history, but remarkably few specific ideas that continue unblemished.
**not sure how to integrate?**

Perhaps my objection seems semantic rather than practical, but I think it presents
two important insights:

 - we should be engaging the group we currently call "students" more like apprentices:
 get them involved in the doing, and pass on insight as part of that doing
 - this is not a special time for learning in their lives, and treating it as
 such may deny them the opportunity to acquire the perspective or skills they will
 need to ensure the future of the discipline

Does such a perspective permit *designing* how we best enable people to become
the best possible participants in our discipline?  Generally, I think no: we do
not generally get to design the challenges we face.  Rather, the task is more akin
to improvisation.  There is a great deal of preparation: of material, for facing
uncertainty, etc.  And that improv is put on by troupe, so we need to know the talents
of our fellows, so we can hand off where appropriate, trust their response,
be comfortable not hogging the spotlight, *etc*.

But that is rehearsal, not design.  Design just seems too inflexible a connotation.
The design part is selling tickets, getting the audience in the door - not what
happens during the show.

Perhaps I'm saying I think the design part is quite simple: get these new engineering
recruits working on interesting problems, starting with parts that they can
engage with, and have a plan for providing them feedback on their work and
access to resources that they will need to solve those problems.

But rehearsal to make that design successful is going to be rough, because I think
that looks almost nothing like the traditional education most of us received:
lectures, homework, and exams.

Julie notes:

 - disagreeing with design seems confrontational - don't really seem to disagree
 with design, so much as what other people are calling design: creating static
 artifact
 - add concrete practical experience: probably from structure of STDIO course,
 with course emphasis on having project, then sessions on how to attack the problem
